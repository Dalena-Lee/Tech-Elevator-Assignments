Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved
Expected output:
false
Actual output:
true
How did you fix this bug?
I printed out each column in returnTimesheet and manually verified if each column matched my test values.
The bug was that the isBillable method returned the incorrect value, which was "true" when it was set to false.
The isBillable method itself has nothing wrong with it. I fixed the bug by adding billable to the jdbc update template
because the update statement for billable was missing.

Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project
Expected output:
2
Actual output:
1
How did you fix this bug?
I fixed this bug by changing the 'if' argument to 'while' because if only returns
one object.

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project
Expected output:

Actual output:

How did you fix this bug?
I fixed this bug by changing the where statement in the query string to project_id instead of employee_id.

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
deleted_timesheet_cant_be_retrieved
Expected output:

Actual output:

This bug cleared once I fixed bug #2.
